# Titanic Survival Predictions

## Overview

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Predictions project! This project is being developed as part of my ongoing data science internship at Encryptix. The goal is to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using various machine learning techniques. This README provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and details on how to run the code.

## Project Description

The Titanic Survival Predictions project involves building a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. The project includes:

- **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and data transformation.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to uncover patterns and relationships.
- **Model Implementation**: Training various machine learning models to predict survival.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using different metrics.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Machine learning model training and evaluation

## Libraries and Tools Used

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-predictions.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd titanic-survival-predictions
   ```
3. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Titanic_Survival_Predictions.ipynb` and run all cells to see the data analysis, model training, and evaluation process.

2. **Main Script**:
   Alternatively, you can run the main Python script if available:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
