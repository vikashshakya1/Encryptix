# Data Science Internship at Encryptix

Welcome to the repository documenting my Data Science Internship at Encryptix. During this internship, I had the opportunity to work on three major projects: Titanic Survival Prediction, Movie Rating Prediction with Python, and Credit Card Fraud Detection. Below you will find an overview of each project, including objectives, methodologies, and key outcomes.

## Titanic Survival Prediction

### Objectives
- Predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic.
- Analyze historical passenger data to identify key factors influencing survival rates.

### Methodologies
- **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Used the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features like FamilySize and Title.
- **Model Building**: Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Evaluation**: Assessed models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Key Outcomes
- Identified key features such as Age, Sex, Pclass, and Fare that significantly influence survival.
- Achieved a high accuracy with Gradient Boosting and Random Forest models.

## Movie Rating Prediction with Python

### Objectives
- Build a model to predict the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors.
- Analyze historical movie data to understand factors influencing movie ratings.

### Methodologies
- **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Collected movie datasets from IMDb.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted features such as Genre, Director, Actors, and Runtime.
- **Model Building**: Used Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluated models using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score.

### Key Outcomes
- Discovered that features such as Genre, Director, and Runtime have a significant impact on movie ratings.
- Gradient Boosting and Random Forest models provided the most accurate predictions.

## Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Objectives
- Detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
- Develop a model to differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

### Methodologies
- **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Used a credit card transaction dataset with anonymized features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, scaled features, and balanced the dataset using SMOTE.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created additional features to improve model performance.
- **Model Building**: Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost), and Neural Networks.
- **Evaluation**: Used accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC for model evaluation.

### Key Outcomes
- Ensemble methods like LightGBM and CatBoost demonstrated superior performance in detecting fraudulent transactions.
- Identified key factors influencing fraud, such as transaction amount and time.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Data Processing**: Jupyter Notebooks
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub

## Conclusion

During my internship at Encryptix, I successfully completed three significant data science projects. These projects enhanced my understanding of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. The experience also honed my skills in using various machine learning algorithms and tools, preparing me for future challenges in the field of data science.
